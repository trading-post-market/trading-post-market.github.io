Last Thursday was the first Trading Post Market! We had a great time hanging out with creative local food producers, chatting about cooking and baking tips, making new friends, and enjoying Titletown beer.

Fifteen [vendors](/vendors) joined the first market and provided a huge range of products from organic meat and vegetables to heritage grains, sunflower oil, mushrooms, and exotic melons.

People of all ages visited the market and stayed around for a few beers at Titletown's cozy, warm tap room.

When we set out to organize this market, we had [many goals](/about), but the primary motivator was to help meet the demand for local produce during the winter months. As our tagline says, local food doesn't hibernate! We also wanted the market to be a welcoming, warm place to hang out during the winter rather than a drop in and head out experience.

This first event was a great step toward those goals and a deep learning experience for everyone involved! We're excited to keep the market going this year and keep growing it to support our goal to create opportunities to experience and support local food culture, education, and creativity.

## What's next?

Trading Post Market takes place every Thursday through December 21 (except Thanksgiving) from 4:00 - 7:30 PM in the [Titletown Tap Room](https://www.facebook.com/tbctaproom/).
