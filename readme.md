# Jekyll Base Template

A simple as possible Jekyll template â€“ only what you need to get started with a new Jekyll project.

Most Jekyll themes are fully-featured projects with lots of bells and whistles. But, if you're just looking for the basics that you need to get started with a new project, or if you're just learning how to use Jekyll for the first time, it can be frustrating to customize a theme that already has a lot of pre-built features. This is a starter template that's as simple as possible so you can add on what you need when you need it!

Here's what it includes:

1. A few HTML templates and stylesheets.
2. A few example blog posts.
3. A loop in `index.html` to show the posts.
4. An example page.
5. A config file with a few common presets.

## Getting started

First you'll need [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) installed, and you'll need to know how to use the command line and Git. If you're not up to speed on those, read about the [command line](http://kevinmcgillivray.net/introduction-to-text-editors-and-the-command-line/), and [try Git](http://try.github.io). Check the [Jekyll website](http://jekyllrb.com) for installation instructions.

1. Navigate to the location you want to create your project in the command line.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/kmcgillivray/jekyll-base-template.git`
3. Navigate into the cloned repository: `cd jekyll-base-template`
4. Run Jekyll: `jekyll serve`
5. Go to `http://localhost:4000` in a browser.

## Notes

This project *doesn't* use the [gem-based themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) introduced in Jekyll 3.2. It's designed for someone who wants to build their own site from a starting point, and the gem-based themes are great but it adds another layer of complexity to getting started quickly at the beginning.
