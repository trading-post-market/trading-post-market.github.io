title: About Trading Post Market
---

Our mission is to nurture the health and well-being of the Northeast Wisconsin community by creating opportunities to **experience and support local food culture, education, and creativity**.

## Community

The more ways we have to share food with each other, the stronger our community is. Our local climate and culture creates a unique opportunity to connect our community through through vibrant shared experiences around food.

## Warm and welcoming

We like to think differently about what a market experience can be. Why should you choose between going to the store or going to a restaurant? At Trading Post Market you can do both. Stroll through the market, then meet friends at the table for Titletown's best brew. This is a cozy, warm, and welcoming market in the heart of downtown's activity.

## Food Education and Creativity

This market is uniquely focused on showcasing examples of unique, creative local food culture and providing opportunities for everyone to explore and deepen their understanding and personal food creativity. As we grow, we will experiment with new ideas to create a market experience all about food education and creativity.
